I'm a B.Sc student of Amirkabir University of Technology in the Computer Engineering department, interested in Computer Vision, Object Detection, Generative Models, and Gait Analysis.

# Researches & Projects

* **Gait Recognition** <br/>
This project is in progress and also is my bachelor thesis under the supervision of [Prof. Safabakhsh](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zFsdqo8AAAAJ&hl=en).  
This project is about the re-identification of persons using each subject’s gait (unique walking pattern) from their
specific estimated pose. This project utilizes deep learning approaches like convolutional, pooling, and HPM layers.
Also, triplet loss is used for training procedures.

* **Image Colorizer** <br/>
Implemented a model with CycleGAN & pix2pix architectures for translating black & white images into colorized images. This model uses Cycle & Identity loss functions because it aims to translate a picture’s attributes to another domain and keep the main characteristics from the source domain. This model has
trained on the CelebA dataset to colorize face parts. [GitHub](https://github.com/KoroshRH/Image-Colorizer)

* **MNIST Handwritten Digits Classifier** <br/> 
Implemented a neural network from scratch without using frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch. This model has flexible layers and neurons on each layer and has the Momentum feature to improve the training procedure’s speed and accuracy. This project is based on the **MNIST handwritten digits dataset**. [GitHub](https://github.com/KoroshRH/MNIST-handwritten-classifier)

* **InceptionV3 Transfer Learning** <br/>
Developed a cat vs. dog classifier by fine-tuning the InceptionV3 model. This model is trained by freezing the convolutional layers and adding some dense layers to train them on the specific dataset. Also, this model uses the Dropout layer to prevent overfitting problems. [GitHub](https://github.com/KoroshRH/InceptionV3-transfer-learning)
