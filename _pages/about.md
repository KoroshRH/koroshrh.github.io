I'm a B.Sc student of Amirkabir University of Technology in the Computer Engineering department, interested in Computer Vision, Object Detection, Generative Models, and Gait Analysis.

# Researches & Projects

* **Gait Recognition** <br/>
This project is in progress and also is my bachelor thesis under the supervision of Prof. Safabakhsh.  
This project is about the re-identification of persons using each subject’s gait (unique walking pattern) from their
specific estimated pose. This project utilizes deep learning approaches like convolutional, pooling, and HPM layers.
Also, triplet loss is used for training procedures.

* **Image Colorizer** <br/>
Implemented a model with CycleGAN & pix2pix architectures for translating black & white images into colorized images. This model uses Cycle & Identity loss functions because it aims to translate a picture’s attributes to another domain and keep the main characteristics from the source domain. This model has
trained on the CelebA dataset to colorize face parts. [GitHub](https://github.com/KoroshRH/Image-Colorizer)
